Simple-Plagiarism-Checker
Web application of Plagiarism Checker using Python-Flask. TF-IDF and cosine similarity is a very common technique. It allows the system to quickly retrieve documents similar to a search query. Similarly, based on the same concept instead of retrieving documents similar to a query, it checks for how similar the query is to the existing database file.

Steps:
User enters a query
Query gets processed (Uppercase to lowercase, Removal of punctuationmarks, etc.)
Calculations are done (Term Frequency, Cosine Similarity)
The Plagiarism Percentage is returned on the web page
Python-Flask
Flask is a light-weight web framework for Python
Easy to work with (Same syntax as of Python)
While Flask addresses itself as a "micro-framework", it is not lacking in features or power, especially with a clutch of extensions to support features such as authentication, databases and so on
Comprehensive documentation available
